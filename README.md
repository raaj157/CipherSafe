# CipherSafe — Password Manager (Client-only)

A lightweight, client-side password manager built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vite**. CipherSafe was developed as a portfolio project to demonstrate CRUD flows, client-side persistence, and user-friendly interactions. This project is intentionally **client-only** and does **not** implement encryption or server-side sync.

## 🚀 Features
- **Add / Edit / Delete credentials** (site, username, password)
- **Copy to clipboard** with subtle toast feedback
- **Search & filter** credentials quickly
- **Persistent storage** using `localStorage`
- Built with **React + Tailwind + Vite**
